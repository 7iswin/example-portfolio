### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

The human body is an incredible and complex sensing system. Environmental factors trigger a wide range of automatic neurophysiological responses. Biometric sensors can capture these responses in real time, providing clues about the underlying biophysical mechanisms. In this prototype study, we demonstrate an experimental paradigm to holistically capture and evaluate the interactions between an environmental context and physiological markers of an individual operating that environment. A cyclist equipped with a biometric sensing suite is followed by an environmental survey vehicle during outdoor bike rides. The interactions between environment and physiology are then evaluated though the development of empirical machine learning models, which estimate particulate matter concentrations from biometric variables alone. Here, we show biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body. This work sets the stage for future investigations of these interactions for a larger number of factors, e.g., black carbon, CO2, NO/NO2/NOx, and ozone. By tapping into our body’s ‘built-in’ sensing abilities, we can gain insights into how our environment influences our physical health and cognitive performance.

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a brain imaging technique in which electrodes are placed on the scalp. EEG signals are commonly decomposed into frequency bands called delta, theta, alpha, and beta. While these bands have been shown to be useful for characterizing various brain states, their utility as a one-size-fits-all analysis tool remains unclear. The goal of this work is to outline an objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra. A two-step data-driven methodology is presented for objectively determining the best EEG bands for a given dataset. First, a decision tree is used to estimate the optimal frequency band boundaries for reproducing the signal’s power spectrum for a predetermined number of bands. The optimal number of bands is then determined using an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-inspired quality score that balances goodness-of-fit with a small band count. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. Additionally, key spectral components were isolated in dedicated frequency bands. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
